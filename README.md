# mykukun-challenge

This is my challenge for the Front-End job. Im going to be honest and i will say that doing .mds is not my thing. 

It was an exciting and fun challenge to do, i had my struggles but searching and asking to friends i finished it, and im proud.

First of all, in this GitHub are all the files for the challenge. In the mail that Maria Gabriela send me, said that the data must come from a php file.
So i did a php with the array for the second array of information to draw the graphic. But it has no server side because this was a front-end challenge.

Usually i do the charts with the Chart.js library. Since i cant use it here, i looked up how to do it with pure css first (it was mind blowing, i used
sin, cosin, hypotenuse, and other trigonometry things), and then i realized that i could use svgs

Im looking forward for a new interview where i can explain why i wrote the code in the way i did it.

pd: i promise to get better with .mds
